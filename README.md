# samsite
Created a webapp that accepts JSON files and renders a graph from said data.

Link to specific JSON test file to test the website: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samsterpiece/samsite/master/userUploadedFiles/smallEditData.json
Link to heroku-deployed webapp version:  https://samsterapp.herokuapp.com/
Web app created utilizing the data from https://randomuser.me/ .

Use this link to get a JSON file easily. You can adjust the value "5000" as it accepts any user size from 1 to 5000. https://randomuser.me/api/?results=5000 (i.e: Can upload JSON file that comes from https://randomuser.me/api/?results=400 instead of 5000)

Expected data format should be in JSON format from the randomuser website. Any other JSON file will give an error.


plain text and xml is in developmental mode, with some logic implemented but no full functionality as of this moment.
