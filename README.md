# samsite
Created a webapp that accepts JSON files and renders a graph from said data.

Updated website to have it where user clicks on "here" button to be provided a random User generated JSON file to feed into the site.

Link to heroku-deployed webapp version:  https://samsterapp.herokuapp.com/
API used on webapp derived from: https://randomuser.me/ .

Expected data format should be in JSON format from the randomuser website. Any other JSON file will give an error.
plain text and xml is in developmental mode, with some logic implemented but no full functionality as of this moment.
